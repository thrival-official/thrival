## #Introduction
Thrival is a community to agitate and educate toward a new western culture. A community to seed a culture capable of urgently resolving today's challenges and ushering in a new era marked by collaboration, scientific advancement, and post-scarcity.

We recognize qualitative results are driven by quantitative changes and build critical mass behind revolutionary enlightenment by growing support behind the following ideas:

+ ü§ù Metamodernism to exceed and include postmodernism for a cultural enlightenment rooted in agonism over antagonism and sincerity over irony.

+ ‚úÖ Economic democracy to exceed and include political democracy for a political enlightenment rooted in positive rights over negative rights and protopia over utopia.

+ üö® Immediate crisis planning to exceed and include archaic reactionary states, rooted in mutual aid over charity and material need over idealism.

These overarching goals may be best illustrated by a new bill of rights to augment and supercede the old.
